### General Overview

### Motivation for Unit

I currently have a class with seniors that took the AP CSP exam their junior year. I currently use the PLTW Cybersecurity curriculum with them. While I think it is definitely important for them to learn about cybersecurity as it pertains to ethics and various societal impacts, many have said they wish they could focus on game design. PLTW has a Game Design and Development course that uses Roblox, which the kids are already familiar with; so, I will be using it as a jumping off point/reference resource as I embark on my journey into the world of game design/development.  The end goal is to develop an introductory unit that is accessible to both beginner and advanced CS students.  Ultimately, having exposure to game design and development will serve to round out the studentsâ€™ over all computer science experience and skill set.
