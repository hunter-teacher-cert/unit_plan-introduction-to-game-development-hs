# Game Design with Roblox
by Latoya Boland

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

In this unit, students will create online experiences using Roblox Studio for developing games and virtual worlds.  
Students will learn design and development skills through different activities using the Roblox Studio and script editor.  The are five main compoents of the unit include:
  - Getting to know Roblox 
  - Advanced IDE Concepts 
  - Prompts 
  - Programming 
  - Create Game 
Students will complete various activities that will build their understanding of the various components necessary to design and develop games in Roblox.  After completing all of the activities, students will be challenged to complete their own game utilizing all of the concepts and skills they learned throughout the unit.  

This unit will be completed during our double-period session on Fridays as a stand-alone CS application series.

### Motivation for Unit

I currently have a class with seniors that took the AP CSP exam their junior year. I currently use the PLTW Cybersecurity curriculum with them. While I think it is definitely important for them to learn about cybersecurity as it pertains to ethics and various societal impacts, many have said they wish they could focus on game design. PLTW has a Game Design and Development course that uses Roblox, which the kids are already familiar with; so, I will be using it as a jumping off point/reference resource as I embark on my journey into the world of game design/development.  The end goal is to develop an introductory unit that is accessible to both beginner and advanced CS students.  Ultimately, having exposure to game design and development will serve to round out the students’ over all computer science experience and skill set.
