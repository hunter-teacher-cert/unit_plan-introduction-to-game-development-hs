# Game Design with Roblox
by Latoya Boland

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

In this unit, students will create online experiences using Roblox Studio for developing games and virtual worlds.  
Students will learn design and development skills through different activities using the Roblox Studio and script editor.  There are five main compoents the unit will include:
  - Getting to know Roblox 
  - Advanced IDE Concepts 
  - Prompts 
  - Programming 
  - Create Game 


Students will complete various activities that will build their understanding of the various components necessary to design and develop games in Roblox.  After completing all of the activities, students will be challenged to design/develop their own game utilizing all of the concepts and skills they learned throughout the unit.  

This unit will be completed during our double-period session on Fridays as a stand-alone CS application series.

### Motivation for Unit

I currently have a class with seniors that took the AP CSP exam their junior year. I currently use the PLTW Cybersecurity curriculum with them. While I think it is definitely important for them to learn about cybersecurity as it pertains to ethics and various societal impacts, many have said they wish they could focus on game design. PLTW has a Game Design and Development course that uses Roblox, which the kids are already familiar with; so, I will be using it as a jumping off point/reference resource as I embark on my journey into the world of game design/development.  The end goal is to develop an introductory unit that is accessible to both beginner and advanced CS students.  Ultimately, having exposure to game design and development will serve to round out the students’ over all computer science experience and skill set.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

- 9-12.CT.1 Create a simple digital model that makes predictions of outcomes.

- 9-12.CT.4 Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

- 9-12.CT.5 Modify a function or procedure in a program to perform its computation in a different way over the same inputs, while preserving the result of the overall program.

- 9-12.CT.6 Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.

- 9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent,
personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

- 9-12.CT.9 Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.
